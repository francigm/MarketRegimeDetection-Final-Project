# Project Proposal: Market Regime Detection and Risk Analysis

Financial markets transition through distinct phases; bull markets, bear markets, and sideways periods, each characterized by different return and volatility patterns. This project aims to develop and compare machine learning models capable of automatically detecting these latent market regimes using only observable financial data.

The primary objective is to identify and compare three unsupervised learning approaches for market regime detection: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), and K-Means clustering. Using 20 years of daily S&P 500 Index data (2005-2025), the project will engineer features from logarithmic returns and rolling 20-day volatility measures, then train and compare the three models to detect three market regimes (bull, bear, sideways). Model performance will be evaluated using information criteria (BIC/AIC), regime statistics, and risk metrics (VaR, CVaR, Sharpe Ratio) to determine which approach provides the most accurate regime detection and better risk assessment for portfolio management.

The analysis uses probabilistic clustering models (GMM, HMM) and a baseline non-probabilistic method (K-Means) to identify regimes. HMM captures temporal dependencies and regime persistence through transition matrices, while GMM provides flexible probabilistic assignments. K-Means serves as a baseline to demonstrate the limitations of methods without temporal structure for financial time series. The project will determine which model provides the most accurate regime detection and better risk assessment capabilities, with HMM expected to excel due to its explicit modeling of regime transitions and temporal persistence.
